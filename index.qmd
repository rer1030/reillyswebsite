## About me

My name is Reilly Richardson and I am a junior Biomedical Science major in the Medical Microbiology option at UNH.I am from Windham, NH. I am very interested in studying pathogenic microbes and I have really been enjoying getting to see how using R may be applicable to me in organizing and presenting data for the future.

## Goals

-   Finish my bachelor's degree
-   Apply to graduate programs in microbiology
-   Hopefully have a career in infectious disease research!

## Outside the classroom

I love spending time with family, friends, and my dog!

Her name is Dottie!
