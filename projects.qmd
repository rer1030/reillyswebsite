I don't have a ton going on right now, but I have been shadowing in the Jeffers lab studying *Toxoplasma gondii* for the last few years, and I hope to start working on a senior thesis next semester! I am excited to get to work on a project of my own.

Some other things I do on campus are a capella and peer coaching for organic chemistry!
